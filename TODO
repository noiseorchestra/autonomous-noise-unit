==TODO==

- DRY: peer2peer session code
- BUG: if p2p connection fails then you get stuck
- make stereo default
- save configuration settings
- reconfigure meter levels
- add choice of servers
- hold button shutdown
- replace noisebox with ANU
- don't timeout server in p2p mode
- loop through images in image branch
- show "not connected to internet error" somewhere, when checking IP etc...
- Write unit tests! (15%)
- refactor pytrip_wait to return True / False and message, deal with this in NoiseBox (disconnect JackTrip connections straight away)
- Create "update" functionallity
- adapt jack_monitor & jack_wait to both run in background and handle errors that occur during a session, poll jack_monitor
- remove subprocesses which run as shell (25%)
- move jacktrip and jackd commands to config file
- hello and goodbye messages

==DONE==
- BUG: incorrect setting and rendering order with new menu items
- install and refactor for use with setuptools?
- test showing images and GIFs
- Boost output to headphones (how?? Need to test on hifiberry, might not be needed)
- function for making p2p connections
- make p2p connections menu (50%)
- Settings menu for mono or stereo selection
- Tidy and consistency check code, add descriptions where missing
- Only show single channels in level_meter when in mono
- account for mono connections <--- default is mono
- Stereo return when sending in mono <--- default behaviour
- label meters
- refactor modules and move into folders
- timeout connection call when fails
- fix bug when starting jackd subprocess from systemd
- gracefully close on exit with cleanup script (kill jackd, kill jacktrip)
- tighten up error checks in install script
- catch errors in noisebox script and show fallback screen (starting jackd, attaching to screen, rotary etc...)
- refactor rotary setup scripts (currently in noisebox) into rotary file
- create rotary key state device
- finish rotary key state device
- implement multi-line messages with conditional scrolling
- stop jack_meter when metetring stops
- check meter orientation and convert to correct range
- re-write exception catching with custom errors
- OLED frame rate improvements (HOW?? try new display? best fps is 4.8)
- clone noisebox repo when installing on RPi
- stop level meter dropping below zero
