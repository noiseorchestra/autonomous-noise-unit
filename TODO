==TODO==
- don't store menu values in Class get them on each draw
- ANU title on main page?
- change input channels 1/2 to mono/stereo in the menu
- check organisation of menu items and all names make sense
- larger menu items on main menu?
- advanced config menu
		- p2p IP ADDRESS
		- p value for jackd??
- change server names in config file
- hold button shutdown
- replace noisebox with ANU
- show "not connected to internet error" somewhere, when checking IP etc...
- Write unit tests! (55%)
- refactor pytrip_wait to return True / False and message, deal with this in NoiseBox (disconnect JackTrip connections straight away)
- adapt jack_monitor & jack_wait to both run in background and handle errors that occur during a session, poll jack_monitor
- remove subprocesses which run as shell (25%)
- move jacktrip and jackd commands to config file
- hello and goodbye messages
